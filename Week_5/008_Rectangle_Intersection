Rectangle Intersection

  Goal: find all intersections among a set of N orthogonal rectangles
    Quadratic algo: check all pairs of rectangles for intersection
 
    - non-degeneracy assumption: all x and y coordinates are distinct

  Microprocessors and geometry: 1970s microprocessor design becomes a geometric problem
    - certain wires cannot intersect
    - certain spacing needed between types of wires

  Algorithms and Moore's Law
    - Moore's Law - processing power doubles every 18 months

    Bootstrapping - we get to use the faster computer for bigger circuits

    But bootstrapping is not enough if using a quadratic algorithm
    Bottom-line - linearithmic algorithm is necessary to sustain Moore's Law

  Sweep-line algorithm
    - sweep vertical line from left to right
    - x coordinates of left and right endpoints define events
    - maintain set of rectangles that intersect the sweep line in an interval search tree(using y-intervals of rectangle)
    - left endpoint: interval search for y-interval of rectangle. insert y-interval
    - right endpoint: remove y-interval

  Sweep line reduces 2d orthogonal rectangle intersection search to 1d interval search
