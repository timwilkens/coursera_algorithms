Line Segment Intersection

  Problem: orthogonal line segment intersection search
    - Given N horizontal and vertical line segments, find all intersections

    Quadratic Algorithm: check all pairs of line segments for intersection
      - not practical for large sets

      One assumption to simplify code: nondegeneracy - al x-y coordinates are distinct

    Sweep-line algorithm
      - sweep vertical line from left to right
      - x-coordinates define events
      - horizontal line-segment(left point) - insert y-coordinate into BST
      - horizontal line-segment(right point) - remove y-coordinate from BST

      - vertical line-segement - 1d range search for the y-coordinate interval

    Takes time proportional to N log N + R

  Bottom line: Sweep line reduces 2d orthogonal line segment intersectino search to 1d range search

    What is the worst case running time of the sweep-line algorithm to find all R intersections
      among N orthogonal line segments?

    1. constant + R
    2. log N + R
*   3. N log N + R
    4. N log N + R log N
