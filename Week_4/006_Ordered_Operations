Ordered Operations

  Comparable keys allows us to use binary search to efficiently search our table
  It also allows us to do some other intersting and useful things:
    - return min and max key and value
    - select kth largest
    - select closest to k
    - select between two keys

  Our binary search implementation is great because search now takes log N compares
    - BUT, insertion or deletion still costs N compares

  What is the maximum number of compares to determine the rank of a key in a symbol table
    that is implemented using a sorted array?

  1. constant
* 2. logarithmic
  3. linear
  4. linearithmic
