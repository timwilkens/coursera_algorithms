Memory usage

  Million - 2^20  (bits)     Megabyte
  Billion - 2^30  (bits)     Gigabyte

  Modern machine - now assume a 64-bit machine with 8 byte pointers
    - can address more memory

  Typical memory usage for primitive types and arrays
              bytes
  boolean     1
  byte        1
  char        2
  int         4
  float       4
  long        8
  double      8

  char arrays   2N + 24
  int arrays    4N + 24

  Objects - 16 bytes
  Reference - 8 bytes
  Padding - each object uses a multiple of 8 bytes

  How much memory (in bytes) does a WeightedQuickUnionUF object use as a function of the number of elements N?

  1. ~ N
  2. ~ 2N
  3. ~ 4N
* 4. ~ 8N

  Summary:

    Empirical Analysis
      Execute program to perform experiments
      Assume power law and forumlate a hypothesis for running time
      Model enables us to make predictions

    Mathematical Analysis
      Analyze algorithm to count frequency of operations
      Use tilde notation to simplify analysis
      Model enables us to explain behavior
 
    Scientific Method
      Mathematical model is independent of a particular system; applies to machines not yet built
      Empirical analysis is necessary to validate mathematical models and to make predictions
