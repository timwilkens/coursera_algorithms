Observations

  3-Sum
Running example: Given N distinct integers, how many triples sum to exactly zero?
  30 -40  10
  30 -20 -10

  Related to computational geometry

  Easy to Brute force this problem with a triple for loop

  How do we measure running time?
    - Actual watch
    - Some sort of watch in our programming language

  Run the program on various input sizes and observe how the time changes for large N
    Use the results to develop a mathematical model of the running time
    Then use this to predict a result, and test the result empirically

  System independent effects - algorithm and input data
  System dependent - hardware, software, system

  Easy for us to just run a massive number of experiments

  Suppose that you make the following observations of the running time T(N) (in seconds)
  of a program as a function of the input size N. Which of the following functions best 
  models the running time T(N)?

  1. 3.3 x 10^-4 x N                                N         T(N)
  2. N^2                                           1,000      0.0
* 3. 5.0 x 10^-9 x N^2                             2,000      0.0
  4. 6.25 x 10^-9 x N^2                            4,000      0.1
                                                   8,000      0.3
                                                  16,000      1.3
                                                  32,000      5.1
                                                  64,000      20.5
