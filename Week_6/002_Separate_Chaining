Collision - two distinct keys hashing to same index
  - birthday problem => can't avoid collisions unless we have quadratic amount of memory
  - coupon collector + load balancing => collisions will be evenly distributed

  Challenge: deal with collisions efficiently

  Separate chaining
    - use an array of M < N linked lists
    Hash -  map key to integer i between 0 and M - 1
    Insert - put at front of ith chain
    Search - need to search only ith chain

  - means you will only have to look for ~ M/N entries (assuming even distribution in hashing)
