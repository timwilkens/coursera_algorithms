Selection sort

  In iteration i, find index min of smallest remaining entry (only looking at entries larger than i)
  Swap a[i] and a[min]

  This is quadratic time: (n * (n + 1)) / 2
    The number of compares is FIXED

  Invariants:
    At any time, all entries to the left of our index are in order
    No item to the right or our index is smaller than an element on the left

  N^2 / 2 compares, and about N exchanges (though this varies)

  Running time is insensitive to input: Quadratic time, even if input is sorted
  Data movement is minimal. Linear number of exhanges

  How many compares does selection sort make when the input array is already sorted?
  
  1. linear
* 2. quadratic
  3. logarithmic
  4. exponential
