Generics

  How should we implement stacks and queues of urls, ints, etc...

  Initially, we would have to cut and paste to make separate classes for every type

  Second attempt, create an abstract Object type class 
    Client needs to cast input correctly

  Third attempt: Java Generics
    Avoid casting
    Discover type mismatch errors at compile-time instead of run-time
      We should welcome compile-time errors, and avoid run-time whenever possible


    The array implementation still requires using a cast (the ugly cast)
