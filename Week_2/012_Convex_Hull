Convex Hull

  The convex hull of a set of N points is the smallest perimeter fence enclosing the points
    - smallet convex set containing all the points
    - smallest area convex polygon enclosing the points
    - convex polygon enclosing the points, whose vertices are points in the set

  Output: shoudl be the sequence of vertices in counterclockwise order

  Application: robot motion planning
    - find shortest path in the plane from s to t that avoids a polygonal obstacle

  Farthest pair problem: find points which are the furthest away from each other

  Graham-scan
    - start with point p (with the smallest y-coordinate
    - sort points by polar angle with p (take a vertical line from p, and then sweep counterclockwise)
    - consider points in order. discard the point unless it can create a ccw turn

  Some implementation challenges
    - how do you find p with the smallest y-coordinate?
    - how do you sort points by polar angle with respect to p?
    - how do you determine whether a turn sequence is counterclockwise?
    - how do we sort efficiently?
      - mergesort (N log N) would be much better than shellsort
      - an efficient sorting algorithm enables these kinds of computation

  Counterclockwise turns

    Easy to do in the simple cases
    What should be do with points in a straight line?

    area = (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y * a.y) * (c.x - a.x);
    if (area < 0) return -1; #clockwise
    else if (area > 0) return 1; #counterclockwise
    else return 0; # linear

What is the maximum number of vertices that can be on the convex hull of a set of N points?

  1. constant
  2. logarithmic
* 3. linear (N - imagine a circle. all will be on the hull)
  4. linearithmic
